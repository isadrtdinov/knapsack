## 0-1 Knapsack problem approximate solution

This repository contains 0-1 Knapsack problem approximate solution written in __Rust__. Algorithm description and benchmarks can be found in this [file](https://github.com/isadrtdinov/knapsack/blob/master/knapsack_solution.pdf).

Requiremenrs: __rust__, __cargo__.

To run algorithm on supplied tests:

`cargo run --release < data/<test_no>.public`

`<test_no>` denotes a number of test to run, valid possibilities: `01`, `02`, ..., `09`, `10`
